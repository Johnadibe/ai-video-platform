- npm 9.0.0 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional but recommended)

### Setup Steps

1. Fork and clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-video-platform.git
cd ai-video-platform
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

# Edit .env.local with your values
```

4. Start the database

npm run docker:dev
```

5. Set up the database
```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
```

6. Start the development server

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Running Linters

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format

# Check TypeScript types
npm run type-check
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await instead of callbacks

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Add JSDoc comments for complex components
- Follow the file structure:
  ```tsx
  // Imports
  import { ... } from '...'
  
  // Types
  interface Props {
    ...
  }
  
  // Component
  export function Component({ ... }: Props) {
    ...
  }
  ```

### File Naming Conventions

- React components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts`
- Types: `camelCase.ts` or `types.ts`
- API routes: `route.ts`
- Pages: `page.tsx`

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
